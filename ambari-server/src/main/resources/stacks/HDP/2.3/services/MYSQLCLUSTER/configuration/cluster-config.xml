# Options affecting ndbd processes on all data nodes:
NoOfReplicas=2    # Number of replicas
DataMemory=80M    # How much memory to allocate for data storage
IndexMemory=18M   # How much memory to allocate for index storage
# For DataMemory and IndexMemory, we have used the
# default values. Since the "world" database takes up
# only about 500KB, this should be more than enough for
# this example Cluster setup.

[tcp default]
# TCP/IP options:
portnumber=2202   # This the default; however, you can use any
# port that is free for all the hosts in the cluster
# Note: It is recommended that you do not specify the port
# number at all and simply allow the default value to be used
# instead
